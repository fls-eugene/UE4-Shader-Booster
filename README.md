# UE4 Shader Booster
Simple C# console application that monitors ShaderCompileWorkers.exe and allows to make changes to desired process priority

Press + and - to change priority, ESC to exit

For convenience, I have added a pre-build .exe [here](https://github.com/fls-eugene/UE4-Shader-Booster/blob/master/Builds/UE4-Shader-Booster.exe)

Or download code and compile in Visual Studio

WARNING: High priorities can cause instability
